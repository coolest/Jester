Key changes include repealing restrictive policies on banks holding cryptocurrencies, dismissing SEC cases against crypto firms, and clarifying that certain crypto activities are not subject to securities laws. These moves suggest a more favorable regulatory environment for the crypto industry, with banks and companies gaining greater freedom to operate and new entrants potentially encouraged by reduced litigation risks.

"ETH price is sinking and whales are panic selling. Market turns bearish.
Content: If you haven't already recognized that this is a bear market, it's time to accept reality. At least the whales have already recognized it. Yesterday a whale who had been holding 10,000 ETH for over 900 days finally decided to leave, selling it all for $15.71 million, according to a post by Lookonchain on Twitter. They bought in at an average of $1,295 per ETH back in late 2022, so they still made $2.75 million in profit. The whale could‚Äôve cashed out for a lot more, like $27.6 million when ETH pumped to above $4,000 last year. That's a missed opportunity, even though they could have made more profit is still profit.

It seems that the whales are panicking, most likely because of Trump's tariffs. ETH keeps dumping and the market is feeling it, the price keeps hitting new lows every day. The Fear & Greed Index is at 18, everyone is panicking. On-chain data is showing thousands of ETH being sent to CEXs in just a few hours, this means a lot of selling. It's not like it's just ETH that is doing badly, the broader crypto market isn‚Äôt doing great either.

Even though the sentiment online is very bad, some investors and traders see this as a 'massive opportunity' to buy low. Is ETH a sleeping giant or a sinking ship? We can't be sure anymore.

The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric indicates capitulation, a phase historically linked to market bottoms.

"Post tariffs economic order
Content: 

This video is clear and I feel unbiased.

To me this means a few things:

1) Bitcoin will be the primary between economy unit of exchange 

2) the US(- system) will have multiple tiers:

- general stablecoin meant for within US primary system
- stable coin meant for exchange within US-general ( entities that are in system, but not part of US- primary)
- probably more

Main distinction will be, one will charge a 'fee' to hold, as part of supporting/being a member of the centralized system. This will support any shared needs (military, etc)

US primary will represent a system free of this fee, but, I believe a system that will play out a MMT system: UBI into the population, efficient taxation at the top (IRS retooling supports this IMHO). Placing a majority of the US transactions on chain strongly supports a use of this system.

Eth, sol, etc - they will exist in relationship to these systems. How well anyone of them retains value within this US system (vs leaking value) will determine the degree to which the US supports it/make it's use easy.

Mechanically, that doesn't support L1 health. I don't see a clear reason in this for value to be retained on chain. Eth or who ever serves as an execution layer, will be an enlarged utility token  maintaining that system to support individual support chains. Those chains will likely have unique and distinct relationships any global/national system, but I doubt the tooling will persist that will allow cross boarder value movement. They will develop a method or require a approach that limits this, outside of Bitcoin.

This is my guess at this point.","Time will tell

US primary will represent a system free of this fee, but, I believe a system that will play out a MMT system: UBI into the population, efficient taxation at the top (IRS retooling supports this IMHO). Placing a majority of the US transactions on chain strongly supports a use of this system.

Eth, sol, etc - they will exist in relationship to these systems. How well anyone of them retains value within this US system (vs leaking value) will determine the degree to which the US supports it/make it's use easy.

Mechanically, that doesn't support L1 health. I don't see a clear reason in this for value to be retained on chain. Eth or who ever serves as an execution layer, will be an enlarged utility token  maintaining that system to support individual support chains. Those chains will likely have unique and distinct relationships any global/national system, but I doubt the tooling will persist that will allow cross boarder value movement. They will develop a method or require a approach that limits this, outside of Bitcoin.

As I could see in the description of the meeting the Fed is about to discuss¬†**rate adjustments behind closed doors,**¬†specifically the¬†**advance and discount rates**¬†charged by the Federal Reserve Banks. These rates are very important for monetary policy and can ripple across the entire financial system.

This meeting is probably caused by the recent market dump that has been propagated to all the markets around the world. When these meetings go private it usually means that they are considering something significant and potentially market moving. This is where things get interesting:

Lower rates = cheaper capital =¬†**more liquidity in the markets.**

More liquidity =¬†**risk-on sentiment.**

Risk-on =¬†**Bitcoin and Ethereum getting ready to fly.**

It is time for Powell and the Fed to make a move, I am pretty sure that this is exactly what Trump wanted to trigger in the market with his tariffs and all the dramas. Soon we will know how this end but this is probably a great time to buy the dip before the Fed meeting. Remember, this is not a financial advice and gamble your money with your own risks.

Pump or dump, what is coming next?

As I could see in the description of the meeting the Fed is about to discuss¬†**rate adjustments behind closed doors,**¬†specifically the¬†**advance and discount rates**¬†charged by the Federal Reserve Banks. These rates are very important for monetary policy and can ripple across the entire financial system.

This meeting is probably caused by the recent market dump that has been propagated to all the markets around the world. When these meetings go private it usually means that they are considering something significant and potentially market moving. This is where things get interesting:

Lower rates = cheaper capital =¬†**more liquidity in the markets.**

More liquidity =¬†**risk-on sentiment.**

Risk-on =¬†**Bitcoin and Ethereum getting ready to fly.**

It is time for Powell and the Fed to make a move, I am pretty sure that this is exactly what Trump wanted to trigger in the market with his tariffs and all the dramas. Soon we will know how this end but this is probably a great time to buy the dip before the Fed meeting. Remember, this is not a financial advice and gamble your money with your own risks.

Pump or dump, what is coming next?

Hong Kong SFC allows licensed crypto firms to provide staking services,"tldr; Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has officially allowed licensed crypto firms to offer staking services, provided they adhere to guidelines ensuring customer protection and risk disclosure. Staking involves locking up crypto assets to generate yield through a proof-of-stake mechanism. Firms must obtain prior approval from the SFC and meet specific requirements, including partnering with licensed entities. The move aims to foster growth in Hong Kong's digital asset ecosystem while maintaining regulatory oversight.
