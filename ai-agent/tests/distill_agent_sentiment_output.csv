US gov’t actions give clue about upcoming crypto regulation,"tldr; The article discusses recent U.S. government actions under the Trump administration that signal a shift in cryptocurrency regulation. Key changes include repealing restrictive policies on banks holding cryptocurrencies, dismissing SEC cases against crypto firms, and clarifying that certain crypto activities are not subject to securities laws. These moves suggest a more favorable regulatory environment for the crypto industry, with banks and companies gaining greater freedom to operate and new entrants potentially encouraged by reduced litigation risks.

"ETH price is sinking and whales are panic selling. Market turns bearish.
Content: If you haven't already recognized that this is a bear market, it's time to accept reality. At least the whales have already recognized it. Yesterday a whale who had been holding 10,000 ETH for over 900 days finally decided to leave, selling it all for $15.71 million, according to a post by Lookonchain on Twitter. They bought in at an average of $1,295 per ETH back in late 2022, so they still made $2.75 million in profit. The whale could’ve cashed out for a lot more, like $27.6 million when ETH pumped to above $4,000 last year. That's a missed opportunity, even though they could have made more profit is still profit.

It seems that the whales are panicking, most likely because of Trump's tariffs. ETH keeps dumping and the market is feeling it, the price keeps hitting new lows every day. The Fear & Greed Index is at 18, everyone is panicking. On-chain data is showing thousands of ETH being sent to CEXs in just a few hours, this means a lot of selling. It's not like it's just ETH that is doing badly, the broader crypto market isn’t doing great either.

Even though the sentiment online is very bad, some investors and traders see this as a 'massive opportunity' to buy low. Is ETH a sleeping giant or a sinking ship? We can't be sure anymore.

Historical patterns suggest ETH may be nearing its final leg of decline, with price targets between $990 and $1,240 based on Fibonacci retracement levels. The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric indicates capitulation, a phase historically linked to market bottoms. RSI metrics also suggest further declines before stabilization, aligning with previous cycles.

This video is clear and I feel unbiased.

To me this means a few things:

1) Bitcoin will be the primary between economy unit of exchange 

2) the US(- system) will have multiple tiers:

- general stablecoin meant for within US primary system
- stable coin meant for exchange within US-general ( entities that are in system, but not part of US- primary)
- probably more

Main distinction will be, one will charge a 'fee' to hold, as part of supporting/being a member of the centralized system. This will support any shared needs (military, etc)

US primary will represent a system free of this fee, but, I believe a system that will play out a MMT system: UBI into the population, efficient taxation at the top (IRS retooling supports this IMHO). Placing a majority of the US transactions on chain strongly supports a use of this system.

Eth, sol, etc - they will exist in relationship to these systems. How well anyone of them retains value within this US system (vs leaking value) will determine the degree to which the US supports it/make it's use easy.

Mechanically, that doesn't support L1 health. I don't see a clear reason in this for value to be retained on chain. Eth or who ever serves as an execution layer, will be an enlarged utility token  maintaining that system to support individual support chains. Those chains will likely have unique and distinct relationships any global/national system, but I doubt the tooling will persist that will allow cross boarder value movement. They will develop a method or require a approach that limits this, outside of Bitcoin.

This is my guess at this point.","Time will tell

Eth or who ever serves as an execution layer, will be an enlarged utility token  maintaining that system to support individual support chains. Those chains will likely have unique and distinct relationships any global/national system, but I doubt the tooling will persist that will allow cross boarder value movement. They will develop a method or require a approach that limits this, outside of Bitcoin.

"The bull market is over, bearish sentiment is taking over.
Content: Well everyone, it’s official. The bull market we were all riding 'high' on is done. The total crypto market cap tanked to $2.58T, a brutal 7.3% drop in 24 hours, according to Coingecko. The global market cap dumped 4.96% since last year too. Since Trump’s second term started on January 20, 2025, we’ve lost trillions of dollars in value. That is a bear market signal if I have ever seen one, prices are down over 10% to 20% from their cycle highs, which fits the classic definition of a bear market according to different market guides.

But don't take my word for it, on-chain metrics back this up. Last week, digital asset investment products saw $240M in outflows, with Bitcoin alone bleeding $207M. Investors are scared, most likely by Trump’s tariff plans. Goldman Sachs says the tariffs could push the U.S. into a recession with a 45% chance. Sentiment is more bearish than ever, everyone’s panicking and it’s showing in the market’s performance.

Bear markets are stressful, there is no doubt about it. My suggestion for the best move is to step back a bit. Don’t let the red charts mess with your head. Instead just DCA or average down on solid stuff like BTC and ETH. DCA during the bear market lets you buy more coins at lower prices, it's going to set you up for gains when the market eventually recovers. This is our chance to make money, just play it smart and don’t let the bear get you down.

The global market cap dumped 4.96% since last year too. Since Trump’s second term started on January 20, 2025, we’ve lost trillions of dollars in value. That is a bear market signal if I have ever seen one, prices are down over 10% to 20% from their cycle highs, which fits the classic definition of a bear market according to different market guides.

But don't take my word for it, on-chain metrics back this up. Last week, digital asset investment products saw $240M in outflows, with Bitcoin alone bleeding $207M. Investors are scared, most likely by Trump’s tariff plans. Goldman Sachs says the tariffs could push the U.S. into a recession with a 45% chance. Sentiment is more bearish than ever, everyone’s panicking and it’s showing in the market’s performance.

Bear markets are stressful, there is no doubt about it. My suggestion for the best move is to step back a bit. Don’t let the red charts mess with your head. Instead just DCA or average down on solid stuff like BTC and ETH. DCA during the bear market lets you buy more coins at lower prices, it's going to set you up for gains when the market eventually recovers. This is our chance to make money, just play it smart and don’t let the bear get you down.

"ETH is being drained and no one is talking about it. L2s are thriving while stakers and validators bleed.
Content: Ethereum is scaling, yes. L2s are thriving, yes. But here’s what no one wants to talk about:

ETH, the asset, is slowly becoming economically irrelevant.

We’ve built a modular world where:
	•	L2s (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base) process billions in volume.
	•	They extract MEV, charge transaction fees, and launch tokens.
	•	But ETH — the asset that secures the system — is capturing barely 0.001–0.005% of that economic activity.

Meanwhile:
	•	ETH staking yields are dropping (~3–4%)
	•	ETH issuance is inflating (~2,200 ETH/day)
	•	ETH burn has collapsed (~350/day)
	•	Validators are earning less than U.S. Treasury yields

And all of this is happening while Ethereum provides the settlement, data availability, and security that L2s depend on.

⸻

Here’s the real kicker:

Ethereum is now subsidizing L2s.
ETH holders are watching their asset inflate while L2s print profit.

L2s don’t:
	•	Share sequencer revenue with ETH stakers
	•	Redirect MEV to the base layer
	•	Pay meaningful fees for using Ethereum’s blob space

In fact, some L2s are phasing out ETH gas entirely (e.g., Starknet → STRK).

⸻

“But this is how scaling is supposed to work… right?”

Sure. But scaling without value capture is just charity.

ETH is slowly becoming a public good with no business model.
At some point, stakers will exit, validators will quit, and Ethereum’s trust assumptions collapse.

And if Ethereum becomes insecure or economically unsustainable — L2s suffer too. Because their legitimacy is anchored in Ethereum finality.

⸻

So why isn’t the community talking about this?
	•	Vitalik avoids strict economic enforcement — he favors neutrality and voluntary alignment.
	•	Ethereum devs hate rent-seeking — the culture values openness over monetization.
	•	Retail thinks “L2s use Ethereum = bullish ETH” — but it’s a false equivalence.
	•	No one feels the pain yet — but that’s exactly why it’s dangerous.

⸻

What can we do?
	•	Propose EIPs for MEV burn, L2 fee sharing, blob pricing, and enshrined sequencing
	•	Build a community campaign to make ETH economically secure again
	•	Pressure L2s to stay ETH-aligned, or fork off and stop free-riding

Ethereum is bleeding value while building the future.
Let’s fix the economics before it’s too late.","I couldn’t disagree more. My analysis is as follows. 

Ethereum: A Bullish Outlook on the Future of Decentralized Finance

As I look to the future, Ethereum stands poised for an unprecedented surge that could redefine its role in the blockchain ecosystem. With advancements in staking, the implementation of EIP upgrades, and innovative Layer 2 solutions, Ethereum is not just surviving; it’s thriving and evolving into an unstoppable force in decentralized finance (DeFi).

Staking: A New Era of Passive Income

Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake model has opened up exciting opportunities for investors. Staking ETH not only allows holders to earn attractive yields but also strengthens the network's security and decentralization. As more users lock up their ETH to participate in staking, the circulating supply decreases, creating upward pressure on the price. This shift is not just a trend; it’s a fundamental transformation that positions Ethereum as a reliable source of passive income, attracting both retail and institutional investors.

EIP Upgrades: Enhancing Functionality and Scalability

Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) have been pivotal in driving the network's evolution. Recent upgrades focus on enhancing transaction speed and reducing costs, making Ethereum more accessible to users worldwide. With the successful integration of EIP-1559, which introduced a more predictable fee structure, gas fees are becoming more manageable. This change has not only improved the user experience but has also instilled confidence in the network's long-term viability.

Layer 2 Solutions: The Scalability Revolution

Layer 2 solutions are revolutionizing Ethereum's landscape by significantly increasing transaction throughput while dramatically lowering gas fees. Technologies like Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups are paving the way for a new wave of decentralized applications that can operate seamlessly, even during peak demand periods. These solutions provide a scalable framework that allows Ethereum to handle thousands of transactions per second, making it a strong contender against emerging competitors. As developers flock to build on Layer 2, we’re witnessing a rapid expansion of the DeFi ecosystem that will drive ETH adoption to new heights.

Blobs: A Game-Changer for Data Management

The introduction of ""blobs"" as part of Ethereum's future upgrades is set to revolutionize data handling within the network. By enabling efficient data storage and retrieval, blobs will enhance the performance of decentralized applications, reducing latency and improving user experience. This innovation is particularly crucial for applications requiring high data throughput, such as gaming and NFTs. The ability to manage larger data sets efficiently will draw more developers to the Ethereum platform, further amplifying its utility and demand.

Market Momentum and Institutional Interest

Ethereum’s recent price movements reflect a growing bullish sentiment among investors. The increasing institutional interest, exemplified by major companies and investment firms allocating funds to ETH, signals a robust belief in its future potential. As Ethereum continues to evolve and adapt to market demands, its role as a foundational layer in the blockchain ecosystem will only strengthen, attracting more capital and driving prices higher.

Conclusion

In conclusion, Ethereum is on the brink of a monumental leap forward. The combination of staking rewards, EIP upgrades, Layer 2 scalability, and innovative data management with blobs positions Ethereum not just as a leading blockchain platform but as a cornerstone of the future financial ecosystem. Investors should be optimistic as the developments unfold, paving the way for a new era of growth and adoption that could see Ethereum reach new all-time highs. The bullish case for Ethereum has never been stronger!",vpos,

This action followed a market slump that led to another investor losing over $106M in Ether on Sky. Over $1.36B in positions were liquidated in 24 hours, with the largest being a $7M Bitcoin position on OKX. The market downturn is linked to macroeconomic pressures, including US tariff announcements impacting global markets.

"Fed Emergency Closed-Door Meeting on April 7th at 11:30 AM (ET) - Rate Cuts Incoming? Liquidity Boost? Crypto About to Pump?
Content: Just noticed that the Federal Reserve has scheduled a **closed-door meeting** for **Monday, April 7, 2025, at 11:30 a.m.** (ET) that is officially titled:

https://preview.redd.it/j00q36fkwdte1.png?width=908&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c264afc36b72eda7d6d2dd88a52b51b735a517e

As I could see in the description of the meeting the Fed is about to discuss **rate adjustments behind closed doors,** specifically the **advance and discount rates** charged by the Federal Reserve Banks. These rates are very important for monetary policy and can ripple across the entire financial system.

This meeting is probably caused by the recent market dump that has been propagated to all the markets around the world. When these meetings go private it usually means that they are considering something significant and potentially market moving. This is where things get interesting:

Lower rates = cheaper capital = **more liquidity in the markets.**

More liquidity = **risk-on sentiment.**

Risk-on = **Bitcoin and Ethereum getting ready to fly.**

It is time for Powell and the Fed to make a move, I am pretty sure that this is exactly what Trump wanted to trigger in the market with his tariffs and all the dramas. Soon we will know how this end but this is probably a great time to buy the dip before the Fed meeting. Remember, this is not a financial advice and gamble your money with your own risks.

Pump or dump, what is coming next?

NO RATE CUTS ARE ON THE TABLE FOR THIS MEETING!

There is no discussion at all in the post about the Federal Funds Rate = the interest rate. 

Under discussion is ""Review and determination of the advance and discount rates."" That's the rate at which banks can borrow from the Fed = they are making sure that we're not going to have another SVB implosion.

They'll also probably discuss emergency liquidity facilities.

Basically, they are meeting to ensure that nothing blows up while the market continues its slide. The cavalry is NOT coming.",neg,

Staking involves locking up crypto assets to generate yield through a proof-of-stake mechanism. Firms must obtain prior approval from the SFC and meet specific requirements, including partnering with licensed entities. The move aims to foster growth in Hong Kong's digital asset ecosystem while maintaining regulatory oversight.
