US gov’t actions give clue about upcoming crypto regulation,"tldr; The article discusses recent U.S. government actions under the Trump administration that signal a shift in cryptocurrency regulation. Key changes include repealing restrictive policies on banks holding cryptocurrencies, dismissing SEC cases against crypto firms, and clarifying that certain crypto activities are not subject to securities laws. These moves suggest a more favorable regulatory environment for the crypto industry, with banks and companies gaining greater freedom to operate and new entrants potentially encouraged by reduced litigation risks.

"ETH price is sinking and whales are panic selling. Market turns bearish.
Content: If you haven't already recognized that this is a bear market, it's time to accept reality. At least the whales have already recognized it. Yesterday a whale who had been holding 10,000 ETH for over 900 days finally decided to leave, selling it all for $15.71 million, according to a post by Lookonchain on Twitter. They bought in at an average of $1,295 per ETH back in late 2022, so they still made $2.75 million in profit. The whale could’ve cashed out for a lot more, like $27.6 million when ETH pumped to above $4,000 last year. That's a missed opportunity, even though they could have made more profit is still profit.

It seems that the whales are panicking, most likely because of Trump's tariffs. ETH keeps dumping and the market is feeling it, the price keeps hitting new lows every day. The Fear & Greed Index is at 18, everyone is panicking. On-chain data is showing thousands of ETH being sent to CEXs in just a few hours, this means a lot of selling. It's not like it's just ETH that is doing badly, the broader crypto market isn’t doing great either.

Even though the sentiment online is very bad, some investors and traders see this as a 'massive opportunity' to buy low. Is ETH a sleeping giant or a sinking ship? We can't be sure anymore.

"Ethereum price data highlights $1,000 as the final bottom for ETH","tldr; Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), has seen a steep 65% decline over three months, raising questions about a potential market bottom. Historical patterns suggest ETH may be nearing its final leg of decline, with price targets between $990 and $1,240 based on Fibonacci retracement levels. The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric indicates capitulation, a phase historically linked to market bottoms. RSI metrics also suggest further declines before stabilization, aligning with previous cycles.

"Post tariffs economic order
Content: 

This video is clear and I feel unbiased.

To me this means a few things:

1) Bitcoin will be the primary between economy unit of exchange 

2) the US(- system) will have multiple tiers:

- general stablecoin meant for within US primary system
- stable coin meant for exchange within US-general ( entities that are in system, but not part of US- primary)
- probably more

Main distinction will be, one will charge a 'fee' to hold, as part of supporting/being a member of the centralized system. This will support any shared needs (military, etc)

US primary will represent a system free of this fee, but, I believe a system that will play out a MMT system: UBI into the population, efficient taxation at the top (IRS retooling supports this IMHO). Placing a majority of the US transactions on chain strongly supports a use of this system.

Eth, sol, etc - they will exist in relationship to these systems. How well anyone of them retains value within this US system (vs leaking value) will determine the degree to which the US supports it/make it's use easy.

Mechanically, that doesn't support L1 health. I don't see a clear reason in this for value to be retained on chain. Eth or who ever serves as an execution layer, will be an enlarged utility token  maintaining that system to support individual support chains. Those chains will likely have unique and distinct relationships any global/national system, but I doubt the tooling will persist that will allow cross boarder value movement. They will develop a method or require a approach that limits this, outside of Bitcoin.

"The bull market is over, bearish sentiment is taking over.
Content: Well everyone, it’s official. The bull market we were all riding 'high' on is done. The total crypto market cap tanked to $2.58T, a brutal 7.3% drop in 24 hours, according to Coingecko. The global market cap dumped 4.96% since last year too. Since Trump’s second term started on January 20, 2025, we’ve lost trillions of dollars in value. That is a bear market signal if I have ever seen one, prices are down over 10% to 20% from their cycle highs, which fits the classic definition of a bear market according to different market guides.

But don't take my word for it, on-chain metrics back this up. Last week, digital asset investment products saw $240M in outflows, with Bitcoin alone bleeding $207M. Investors are scared, most likely by Trump’s tariff plans. Goldman Sachs says the tariffs could push the U.S. into a recession with a 45% chance. Sentiment is more bearish than ever, everyone’s panicking and it’s showing in the market’s performance.

Bear markets are stressful, there is no doubt about it. My suggestion for the best move is to step back a bit. Don’t let the red charts mess with your head. Instead just DCA or average down on solid stuff like BTC and ETH. DCA during the bear market lets you buy more coins at lower prices, it's going to set you up for gains when the market eventually recovers. This is our chance to make money, just play it smart and don’t let the bear get you down.

"Fed Emergency Closed-Door Meeting on April 7th at 11:30 AM (ET) - Rate Cuts Incoming? Liquidity Boost? Crypto About to Pump?
Content: Just noticed that the Federal Reserve has scheduled a **closed-door meeting** for **Monday, April 7, 2025, at 11:30 a.m.** (ET) that is officially titled:

As I could see in the description of the meeting the Fed is about to discuss **rate adjustments behind closed doors,** specifically the **advance and discount rates** charged by the Federal Reserve Banks. These rates are very important for monetary policy and can ripple across the entire financial system.

This meeting is probably caused by the recent market dump that has been propagated to all the markets around the world. When these meetings go private it usually means that they are considering something significant and potentially market moving. This is where things get interesting:

Lower rates = cheaper capital = **more liquidity in the markets.**

More liquidity = **risk-on sentiment.**

Risk-on = **Bitcoin and Ethereum getting ready to fly.**

It is time for Powell and the Fed to make a move, I am pretty sure that this is exactly what Trump wanted to trigger in the market with his tariffs and all the dramas. Soon we will know how this end but this is probably a great time to buy the dip before the Fed meeting. Remember, this is not a financial advice and gamble your money with your own risks.

Pump or dump, what is coming next?

Hong Kong SFC allows licensed crypto firms to provide staking services,"tldr; Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has officially allowed licensed crypto firms to offer staking services, provided they adhere to guidelines ensuring customer protection and risk disclosure. Staking involves locking up crypto assets to generate yield through a proof-of-stake mechanism. Firms must obtain prior approval from the SFC and meet specific requirements, including partnering with licensed entities. The move aims to foster growth in Hong Kong's digital asset ecosystem while maintaining regulatory oversight.
